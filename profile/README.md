##Git Best Practices
1. Branching
    - Create branches off of the [dev] branch for distinct work items
    - Branch naming convention: {work item number}_{repo name}
2. Commits
    - Make small, incremental changes for each commit
    - Make changes solely related to each work item
    - Write descriptive commit messages
3. Merging
    - Always create pull requests to merge your working branch into [dev]
    - Obtain code review approval from at least 1 other person
    - If your merge contains conflicts, add the developer who made the conflicting changes to the reviewer list to assist in resolving them
    - Do not merge directly into main or another person's branch
