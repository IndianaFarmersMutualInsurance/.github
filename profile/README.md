## Git Best Practices
1. Repositories
    - Repo naming convention: {teamName}_{projectName}
    - Divide repos into logical project sizes (API, libraries, etc.)
2. Branching
    - Each team will design and document a branching strategy
    - References about strategies [Patterns for Managing Source Code Branches](https://martinfowler.com/articles/branching-patterns.html)
4. Commits
    - Do not commit broken code
    - Write descriptive commit messages
    - Make commits frequently with incremental changes (ideally less than 50 lines)
    - Changes must be solely related to the branch feature/work item
    - Avoid adding referenced projects/files to git unless absolutely necessary
